# COVID-19-Analysis
I thought I would try my hand at combining my Epidemiology and Demography skills to track the COVID-19 pandemic. I had to dust off my old coding books and research a TON to get started with even some basic manipuations, but hey, you have to start somewhere. I am happy to share my data interpreations and manipulastions to anyone who cares to view them. Stay safe and healthy!
